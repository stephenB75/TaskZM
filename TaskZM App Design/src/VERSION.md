#### AI Scheduling Algorithm (Updated 1.4.0)

```
Priority Weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1

Scoring System (lower score = better placement):
- High Priority Tasks: countÃ—100 + prioritySumÃ—10 + dayIndex + weekendPenalty
  - weekendPenalty: 50 for Sat/Sun, 0 for Mon-Fri
- Medium/Low Tasks: countÃ—100 + prioritySumÃ—10

Selection Criteria:
1. Respect 6 tasks/day limit when possible
2. Prefer days with lower task count
3. Consider cumulative priority load
4. High priority â†’ weekdays earlier in week with lower load
5. Medium/low priority â†’ lowest load days (any day)
6. Weekend awareness for work-life balance
```

#### Data Structure

```typescript
Task {
  id: string
