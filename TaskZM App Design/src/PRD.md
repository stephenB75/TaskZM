```typescript
// Dependency detection algorithm
function wouldCreateCircularDependency(
  taskId,
  newDependencyId,
  allTasks,
) {
  // Breadth-first search through dependency graph
  // Returns true if adding dependency would create cycle
}

// Visual status calculation
function getDependencyStatus(task, allTasks) {
  return {
    hasUnmetDependencies: boolean,
    unmetCount: number,
    totalCount: number,
  };

### 3. AI Auto-Scheduler (Bulk)

**Status**: ✅ Implemented (v1.2.0, Enhanced v1.4.0, v1.5.1)

**Description**:
Intelligent bulk scheduling system that distributes all active tasks and inbox items across multiple weeks based on priority, workload, and weekend awareness, while respecting daily task limits.

**Key Capabilities**:

- Schedules all active tasks (todo, in-progress)
- Converts and schedules inbox tasks automatically
- Priority-based distribution (high → medium → low)
- Workload balancing across all 7 days
- Weekend awareness (prefers weekdays for high priority)
- **6 tasks per day limit enforcement** ✨ UPDATED
- **Multi-week spreading when daily limit reached** ✨ NEW
- **Automatic week expansion based on task count** ✨ NEW
- Automatic inbox clearing after scheduling
- **Clear feedback showing weeks used** ✨ NEW

**Algorithm**:

```
Priority Weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1

Multi-Week Calculation:
1. Calculate total tasks to schedule
2. Determine weeks needed: ceil(totalTasks / (limit × 7))
3. Generate day array across all needed weeks

Scoring System (lower score = better placement):
- High Priority: count×100 + prioritySum×10 + dayIndex + weekendPenalty
  - weekendPenalty: 50 for Sat/Sun, 0 for Mon-Fri
- Medium/Low: count×100 + prioritySum×10

Selection Process:
1. Sort tasks by priority (high first)
2. Generate days for calculated number of weeks
3. Find day with lowest score
4. Place task on that day
5. Move to next day when limit reached
6. Repeat until all tasks scheduled
7. Show success message with week count
```

**User Value**:
Eliminates manual scheduling burden, optimizes workload distribution across multiple weeks, ensures high-priority tasks get weekday placement, and maintains sustainable daily workload by respecting limits.

#### Circular Dependency Detection

**Algorithm**: Breadth-first search through dependency graph

**Process**:

1. User selects task B as dependency for task A
2. System checks if B depends on A (directly or indirectly)
3. If cycle detected: Show alert, prevent selection
4. If no cycle: Add dependency

**Example Scenarios**:

- ✅ Allowed: A→B, B→C, C→D
- ❌ Blocked: A→B, B→A (direct cycle)
- ❌ Blocked: A→B, B→C, C→A (indirect cycle)
- ❌ Blocked: A→A (self-reference)

#### Visual Indicators on Task Cards

**Blocked Badge** (when dependencies incomplete):

- Background: `#fef3e0` (light orange)
- Text: `#d87f00` (dark orange)
- Border: `1px solid #ffd699`

5. Distribute tasks to lowest-score days
6. Check if exceeding 6/day limit
7. If exceeding: Show confirmation dialog
8. If confirmed: Apply schedule
9. Clear inbox
10. Show success toast

**Scoring Formula**:

```javascript
for high priority tasks:
  score = (taskCount × 100) + (prioritySum × 10) + dayIndex + weekendPenalty
  weekendPenalty = (day is Sat/Sun) ? 50 : 0

for medium/low priority:
  score = (taskCount × 100) + (prioritySum × 10)
```

#### Individual AI Schedule

**Trigger**: Toggle "AI Smart Schedule" in Add Task modal

**Process**:

1. User toggles switch ON
2. Date/time fields disabled and grayed out
3. User fills other task details
4. On submit: Calculate best day using same scoring
5. Assign task to best day
6. Show success toast with scheduled date
